discordbot
===

A bot that does the discord thing.

`node bot.js --token=DICORDBOTTOKEN --ytapi=YOUTUBEAPIKEY`

Ideas
---
- an instance (class) of the bot for each server
    - planned with datahandler, could be for the whole server in the future
    - save data for each server (custom commands/playlists and so on)
    - custom scripts for each server (?) <- not that hard to code (with the right api)
    - status rotator
    - 
- reddit api
- anilist api
- othercoolstuff api
